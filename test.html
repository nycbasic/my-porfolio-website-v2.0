<p>I currently work as a eLearning Developer & web developer for mid-size financial tech company and passionate and
    aspiring to make a career switch to sofware engineering.</p>
<p>In my current role, I was lucky enough to incorporate my love for coding and provide a value add to my team and the
    company. I was able to create, build and manage a web application from start to finish. I helped improve the user
    experience for the companies e-learning environment, while updating and creating new features along the way using
    the front-end library React.</p>

<p>I'm also working on a project with a non-profit organization to help create a social network that allows them to
    manage their tournament registstration process, tournament results, and scoring using React/Redux, Node.js, Redis
    and SQL for the database.</p>

<p>I'm very passionate about helping businesses solve problems and creating innovative product solutions with tech and
    eager to immerse myself in the field of software engineering. </p>
